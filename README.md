## Philosophy

Momentum aims to be an extension of your mindâ€”a digital second brain that seamlessly integrates into your workflow. Our core design principles are:

* **Undisturbed Flow**: Every interaction is optimized for the keyboard. The minimalist UI and silent operation protect your focus.
* **Information Noise Reduction**: Contextual views, a powerful search, and a clear organizational structure help you find the signal in the noise.
* **Instantaneous Response**: Built with Rust, every action from startup to task creation is engineered to feel instant (<100ms).
* **A Private Harbor**: Your data is yours. Everything is stored locally on your machine by default. You have 100% ownership and control.

## Key Features

* **Lightning-Fast Capture**: Use a global shortcut (`Alt+Space`) to bring up the Quick Add Palette from anywhere in your OS.
* **Structured Organization**: Organize tasks with projects, sub-tasks, priorities, and due dates.
* **Powerful Attachments**: Attach web URLs or local file paths directly to your tasks.
* **Smart Reminders**: Set reminders and get native system notifications so you never miss a deadline.
* **Cross-Platform**: Packaged with Tauri for a consistent experience on macOS, Windows, and Linux.
* **Secure & Local-First**: Your data lives on your machine. No cloud, no accounts, no tracking.
